Automation Testing Repository

This repository contains examples and resources for automated testing using Postman for API testing and Selenium for UI testing. These tests are designed to demonstrate end-to-end functionality and integration of different testing tools.

Structure
API Testing.zip: Contains the Postman collection and environment files used for API testing.
Selenium Automation.zip: Includes Selenium scripts for automated UI testing, along with supporting files.


README.md: This file provides an overview of the repository contents and instructions on how to use the files.

Tools Used
1. Postman (API Testing)
Postman is used for testing RESTful APIs. This section includes:
Postman Collection: A set of API requests to test various endpoints of the application.
Environment Files: Configuration for different environments (e.g., local, production) for dynamic testing.

2. Selenium (UI Automation)
Selenium is used to automate web browser interaction. This section includes:
Selenium Scripts: Automation scripts written to simulate user actions on the UI and validate the behavior of the application.
Browser Drivers: WebDriver binaries are required to run the tests on different browsers.

Getting Started
Postman (API Testing)
Download the API Testing.zip file and extract its contents.
Import the Postman collection and environment files into Postman.
Run the collection to execute the API tests.
Selenium (UI Automation)
Download the Selenium Automation.zip file and extract its contents.

Ensure that you have the necessary WebDriver installed (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver).
Open the project in your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA).
Run the Selenium scripts to perform the automated UI tests.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:

Postman: Make sure you have Postman installed to run the API tests.
Selenium WebDriver: Download and configure the appropriate WebDriver for your browser.
Java: If the Selenium scripts are in Java, ensure that you have JDK installed and configured in your system.
